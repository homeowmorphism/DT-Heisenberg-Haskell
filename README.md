# Run

You will need a version of [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/). 

From the command line, type

```
$ ghci
Prelude> :load HSet.hs
*HSet>
```

With the `HSet` module loaded, you have different options for returning balls of different generating sets (with the option to add more). The default options are `balls2, balls3, ballsKnight`.

```
*HSet> balls2
```
returns the elements in the ball with generating set `gen2`. `Heisenberg.hs` tells us that `gens2` is the symmetric generating set generated by (1,0,0) and (0,1,0), also written in their matrix form as `[[1,1,0],[0,1,0],[0,0,1]]` and `[[1,0,0],[0,1,1],[0,0,1]]`. Thus, `gens2` correspond to the standard generating set of the Heisenberg group.
