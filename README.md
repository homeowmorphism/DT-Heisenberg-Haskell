# Run

## Print the balls themselves
You will need a version of [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/). 

From the command line, type

```
$ ghci
Prelude> :load HSet.hs
*HSet>
```

With the `HSet` module loaded, you have different options for returning balls of different generating sets (with the option to add more). The default options are `balls2, balls3, ballsKnight`.

```
*HSet> balls2
```
returns the elements in the ball with generating set `gen2`. `Heisenberg.hs` tells us that `gens2` is the symmetric generating set generated by `(1,0,0)` and `(0,1,0)`, where the coordinates represent the `(a, b, c)` values of the matrix`[[1,a,b],[0,1,c],[0,0,1]]`. Thus, `gens2` represent the standard generating set of the Heisenberg group group and `(1,0,0)` and `(0,1,0)` are written in their matrix form as `[[1,1,0],[0,1,0],[0,0,1]]` and `[[1,0,0],[0,1,1],[0,0,1]]` respectively. 

## Print the size of the ball

```
$ ghci
Prelude> :load Test.hs
*Test> sizes gen2
```
prints the sizes for the ball with `gens2` as generating set. `Heisenberg.hs` tells us that`gens2` represents the standard generating set. Other preset options in `Heisenberg.hs` are: `gen3` and `genKnight`.

See print the balls themselves section for more details.

# Understanding the code

The code starts with the file `Group.hs` which is simply defined as a monoid with an inverse operation. How to take the inverse is unspecified and left to the individual group. 

`Heisenberg.hs` defines the Heisenberg group, using individual element `Heisen` which inherits the type `Monoid` and takes as input the three parameters `a, b, c` of type `!Int`, which correspond to the coordinates of the group of matrices `[[1,a,b],[0,1,c],[0,0,1]]`. `Heisen` is then defined as a group element with inverse operation which maps `a b c` to `-a -b -c+a*b` (which is the correct formulation given the matrix notation). A type `Gens` (which stands for a generating set) is defined a list of `Heisen` elements. The function `makeSym` makes a given generating set a symmetric one by adding in the `one` element and the inverses of each element.
