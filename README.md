# Run

You will need a version of [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/). 

From the command line, type

```
$ ghci
Prelude> :load HSet.hs
*HSet>
```

With the `HSet` module loaded, you have different options for returning balls of different generating sets (with the option to add more). The default options are `balls2, balls3, ballsKnight`.

```
*HSet> balls2
```
returns the elements in the ball with generating set `gen2` (see .. for )
