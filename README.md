# Run

## Print the balls themselves
You will need a version of [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/). 

From the command line, type

```
$ ghci
Prelude> :load HSet.hs
*HSet>
```

With the `HSet` module loaded, you have different options for returning balls of different generating sets (with the option to add more). The default options are `balls2, balls3, ballsKnight`.

```
*HSet> balls2
```
returns the elements in the ball with generating set `gen2`. `Heisenberg.hs` tells us that `gens2` is the symmetric generating set generated by `(1,0,0)` and `(0,1,0)`, where the coordinates represent the `(a, b, c)` values of the matrix`[[1,a,b],[0,1,c],[0,0,1]]`. Thus, `gens2` represent the standard generating set of the Heisenberg group group and `(1,0,0)` and `(0,1,0)` are written in their matrix form as `[[1,1,0],[0,1,0],[0,0,1]]` and `[[1,0,0],[0,1,1],[0,0,1]]` respectively. 

## Print the size of the ball

```
$ ghci
Prelude> :load Test.hs
*Test> sizes gen2
```
prints the sizes for the ball with `gens2` as generating set. `Heisenberg.hs` tells us that`gens2` represents the standard generating set. Other preset options in `Heisenberg.hs` are: `gen3` and `genKnight`.

See print the balls themselves section for more details.

# Understanding the code

*Since not everyone is simultaneously fluent in Haskell and in the Heisenberg group.*

The code starts with the file `Group.hs` which is simply defined as a monoid with an inverse operation. How to take the inverse is unspecified and left to the individual group. 

`Heisenberg.hs` defines the Heisenberg group, using individual element `Heisen` which inherits the type `Monoid` and takes as input the three parameters `a, b, c` of type `!Int`, which correspond to the coordinates of the group of matrices `[[1,a,b],[0,1,c],[0,0,1]]`. `Heisen` is then defined as a group element with inverse operation which maps `a b c` to `-a -b -c+a*b` (which is the correct formulation given the matrix notation). A type `Gens` (which stands for a generating set) is defined a list of `Heisen` elements. The function `makeSym` makes a given generating set a symmetric one by adding in the `one` element and the inverses of each element. Some generating sets are pre-defined, such as `gen2` (the standard generating set) `gen3` and `genKnight` (the chess generating set). Finally, a function `minkowski` is declared. `minkowski` takes as input two sets of `Heisen` elements and multiply each element of the first set with every element of the second set (I'm not sure I got this completely right). The balls corresponding to the individual generating sets are then recursively defined to be the union of the previous ball multiplied with the generating set. 

## Better than the naive solution

The previous code was rather straightforward. `HSet.hs` briefly increments on this by treating the `c` coordinate in a special way. In the Heisenberg group, the `c` (formally `H 0 0 c`) coordinate is generated by taking the commutator of `a,b`, (formally `H a 0 0, H 0 b 0`) and `c` doesn't generate anything except itself when combined with other generators. This suggest that we can compress the `c` coordinate without affecting our calculations. We are going to group the `c` coordinate as intervals, defined by the data type `IntSet` defined in `IntSet.hs`.

The biggest challenge in understanding `IntSet.hs` is realizing that this data type is supposed to represent a set of intervals with integer values. Once this is clear, the merge function becomes clear.
